# Night Vision Toggler

Hotkey-based gamma + contrast + digital vibrance toggle.

Requirements:
- MinGW-w64 (g++)
- NVIDIA GPU

Hotkeys:
- F3  = toggle ON/OFF
- F5  = Restore System Defaults
- F12 = exit (restores original gamma + DV)

Limitations:
This is currently very early in production. A key limitations are that contrast and digital vibrance value does not perfectly line up with NVIDIA's control panel. I am running an approximation for both.
